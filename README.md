# Campus Take-Away
The Campus Take-Away application will allow students and campus members to order online from campus cafeterias to have their orders ready without waiting in the line during busy hours, which will not only save them time but will also help ensure social distancing. 

This app is planned to initially work solely in Koç University campus. Our design will provide a secure online payment method, along with safe and easy registration to the app’s network for Koç Campus members. To incentivize service providers at the campus, creating and updating their menu will be very simple. One of our key principles for this app is to make both Customer and Service Provider’s journey as easy as possible by eliminating any redundancy.

We aim to make an applicative and sustainable leading mobile-commerce app with features such as consumer specific coupons, recommendations and service rating. We aspire to expand the presence of our app in a broad range of universities, incorporating with various food brands.
